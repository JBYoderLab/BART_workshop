Working with BARTs in R
=======================


README updated 19 April 2024.


Project description
-------------------

Materials for a workshop demonstrating the uses of Bayesian additive regression tree methods implemented in [`dbarts`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbarts) with utilities from [`embarcadero`](https://www.github.com/cjcarlson/embarcadero), as well as [SoftBart](https://www.github.com/theodds/SoftBART). Activities will focus on applications in ecology and biodiversity research.


Contents
--------

- `data` --- supporting materials for the worked examples (more than 100Mb, download with care)
- `topics` --- code and slides for worked examples, organized by topic (see below)
- `output` --- materials output by scripts in the worked examples, including saved models (more than 100Mb, download with care)


Suggested order of operation
----------------------------

The code provided should let you dip into any one example and take what you want from it. However, this material was developed for a multi-day workshop, and that experience is best reproduced if you work through it in the same order as presented.

1. Species distribution modeling with BARTs (binary response)

2. Random intercept BART models

3. Predictor selection, and higher-dimensional data

4. Abundance/frequency data (continuous response)
